I'm a seasoned technology professional with decades of experience spanning programming, network engineering and design, cybersecurity, systems testing, and operations. I currently work as a SOC Analyst at Calian Corporation, specializing in threat detection and response. My career has included roles at major vendors like Nortel and Cisco, as well as service providers including Ribbon, Kandy, and AVC Technologies.\\n\\nBeyond cybersecurity, I’m actively expanding my skills in AI solution engineering, including building custom AI assistants, multi-agent systems, and integrating AI into everyday workflows. I’m also diving deeper into Python, LangChain, and plan to start learning more about smart contract development using Solidity in the future.\\n\\nIn my personal life, I’m a U.S. Army combat veteran, a dog dad to a full range of dog sized machines of destruction (mini Schnauzer, cattle dog mix, and a Great Dane), and an avid language learner working on conversational Mandarin for an upcoming trip to China.\\n\\n## LinkedIn Profile:\\n\\xa0 \\xa0\\nContact\\n36lima@gmail.com\\nwww.linkedin.com/in/kelly-scott-\\nnetterville (LinkedIn)\\nTop Skills\\nResponsive Web Design\\nCascading Style Sheets (CSS)\\nJUnit\\nCertifications\\nTools of the Trade: Linux and SQL\\nMicrosoft Certified: Azure\\nFundamentals\\nConnect and Protect: Networks and\\nNetwork Security\\nPlay It Safe: Manage Security Risks\\nFoundations of Cybersecurity\\nKelly Netterville\\nSoftware Developer with Security Focus || Continuous Learning is\\na Passion || Experienced IT Professional || Proud US Army Veteran\\n(1988-1997).\\nFairfield Bay, Arkansas, United States\\nSummary\\nWhether it's learning new languages, playing music, or learning how\\nto fly a helicopter, I love a challenge, especially one that exposes me\\nto new concepts and ideas. \\nI began my career in technology in the Army as a fresh-faced 17-\\nyear-old.
